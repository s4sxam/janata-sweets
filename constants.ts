A silver spoon is lifting a perfect dollop, showing the smooth interior. Depth of field with a blurred background of a festive Indian kitchen. Vibrant colors, appetizing, hyper-realistic, 8k."

    image: "AI_GEN:Professional studio photography of a stack of Kaju Rolls (Indian cashew nut fudge) arranged neatly on a contemporary ceramic plate. The rolls have a creamy off-white, smooth texture with a distinct bright green pistachio filling visible at the ends. Each roll is delicately wrapped in shimmering edible silver foil (vark) that catches the light. Soft, diffused overhead lighting to highlight the silky finish of the cashew paste. Minimalist background with a few whole cashew nuts scattered nearby. 8k resolution, hyper-realistic, commercial food styling."
